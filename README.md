Phlex lets you compose web views in pure Ruby â€” kind of like JSX, but not really anything like JSX. Itâ€™s super-fast, thread-safe and supports TruffleRuby v23.1+ and CRuby 3.2+. Phlex currently supports [HTML](https://rubydoc.info/gems/phlex/Phlex/HTML) and [SVG](https://rubydoc.info/gems/phlex/Phlex/SVG) views, and weâ€™re exploring JSON and XML.

## Maintenance schedule

### Bug fixes
- Only the latest minor version of each major version will receive bug fixes.
- We may choose to fix bugs by releasing a new minor version rather than patching the existing minor version.
- Major versions will stop receiving bug fixes one year after the next major version is released.
- We are not likely to attempt to fix bugs that affect [maintained versions of Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/), even if our gemspec lists support for unmaintained versions of Ruby.

### Security patches
- When a security issue is brought to our attention, we aim to release patches for any minor version that was released in the last year.
- Additionally, the latest minor version of the latest major version will receive security patches, even if that version is over a year old.
